# CommodityVectorsTest
Technical test

This is meant to be ran in a virtualenv.

To install this project:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run it:

`cd {REPO}/api`
`apistar run`

Documentation is at 127.0.0.1:8080/docs

There are some testing abilities on this page but I advise using postman instead since the page can struggle handling big amounts of data.

I also put the notebook that I used in order to create the predictor that I use.

To read it:

`cd {REPO}/`

`ipython notebook`

the notebook is under directory "ipython notebook"
